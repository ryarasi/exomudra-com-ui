# Exomudra Technologies

> Exomudra Technologies is an early-stage deep tech startup based in Chennai, India, currently in the prototyping stage. We are building the next generation human machine interface through wireless smart gloves that enable natural hand gesture interaction with computers, replacing rigid controllers with intuitive and immersive experiences.

## Company Overview

Exomudra Technologies Private Limited is a deep tech startup founded to revolutionize human-machine interaction. The company is incubated at iTNT Hub and focuses on developing advanced motion capture technology through smart gloves.

**Location**: Chennai, India
**Stage**: Early-stage, prototyping phase
**Incubator**: iTNT Hub
**Founded**: 2021
**Industry**: Deep Tech, Hardware, Motion Capture

## The Problem We Solve

### Rigid VR Controllers
Current VR input devices are unergonomic and fail to deliver true hand presence, limiting natural interaction and cross-platform adaptability. Their limitations in dexterity, versatility, and expressive control restrict users from having truly immersive experiences.

### Limited Accessibility
9 out of 10 people who use sign language globally don't have access to affordable, accurate translation technology. This creates a significant barrier for communication and accessibility.

### Technology Adaptation
We believe technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around. Current interfaces force users to learn complex control schemes rather than leveraging natural human gestures.

## Our Solution: Smart Gloves

Exomudra develops wireless smart gloves that offer:

### Core Features
- **Natural Hand Gesture Control**: Intuitive hand control that enables natural, immersive interaction
- **Real-time Haptic Feedback**: Enhanced tactile experiences that provide sensory confirmation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless integration with AR, VR, gaming consoles, Unity, Unreal Engine, and SteamVR
- **Lightweight Design**: Ergonomic construction for extended use sessions
- **Energy Efficient**: Low-cost, battery-optimized design for general consumer use

### Key Applications

#### Game Controller
Replace traditional VR/AR controllers with natural hand gestures for gaming applications, specifically targeting PC/Steam VR ecosystem and indie game development studios.

#### Sign Language Translation
Real-time sign language translation capabilities for improved accessibility and communication, serving the global deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

#### Creative Professional Tools
Intuitive input controller for creative professionals including video editors, animators, 3D artists, and game developers to maximize productivity and creative control.

#### Motion Capture for Entertainment
Professional motion capture solutions for animation in movies, video game cutscenes, and digital content creation.

#### VR Training and Simulation
Enhanced training experiences for industrial jobs, educational institutions, healthcare, defense, and professional development programs.

## Products

### Exomudra Sanjna (Lite) - Rs. 25,000
The Sanjna (Sanskrit: सञ्ज्ञा, meaning "gesture/sign") is the lite version without force feedback, designed primarily for sign language translation and gesture-based interaction.

**Features:**
- Precision gesture tracking with IMU + flex sensor fusion
- Designed for sign language translation and accessibility
- Wireless low-latency connectivity
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Lightweight ergonomic build
- Free Exomudra Configurator for universal device mapping
- Includes 1 year software subscription

### Exomudra Shakti (Pro) - Rs. 50,000
The Shakti (Sanskrit: शक्ति, meaning "power/force") includes an active force-feedback mechanism using motors to introduce resistance to finger motion. This enables finger strengthening for rehabilitation patients and haptic feedback for VR/AR.

**Features:**
- Everything in Sanjna, plus:
- Active force-feedback motors for finger resistance
- Haptic feedback on touching virtual surfaces
- Finger strengthening for rehabilitation patients
- Immersive VR/AR control with tactile response
- Free Exomudra Configurator for universal device mapping
- Includes 1 year software subscription

### Software Subscription
First year is free with hardware purchase. Annual subscription required for continued software updates, cloud features, and gesture library access.

### Exomudra Configurator (Free)
Every unit ships with the Exomudra Configurator — a desktop application that patches the firmware to allow the buyer to map the glove as any hardware input device (keyboard, mouse, MIDI, gamepad, etc.) for any use case.

## Technology and Innovation

### Sensor Technology
The gloves utilize advanced sensor fusion technology with IMU + flex sensors for precise hand tracking. The proprietary sensor fusion algorithms overcome common drift issues inherent in IMU-only solutions. The Shakti model uses rack-and-pinion mechanisms with magnetic encoders (AS5600) for 0.087-degree angular resolution.

### Force Feedback (Shakti only)
Motor-driven resistance on each finger via tendon-driven mechanisms connected to smart servos. Creates the sensation of touching and gripping real objects in virtual space. Also serves as a rehabilitation tool for progressive finger strengthening.

### Wireless Connectivity
Self-contained glove system with no external trackers or cameras required, reducing setup time and costs while maintaining low latency for real-time applications.

### Cross-Platform Integration
Full compatibility with major platforms and development environments:
- Unity game engine
- Unreal Engine
- SteamVR
- Mobile devices
- Personal computers
- Gaming consoles

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Fully Mobile Solution**: Self-contained design eliminates need for external tracking systems
2. **Affordable Innovation**: Gesture-based input at 2-5x lower cost than competitors
3. **Broad Market Focus**: Cross-sector applicability versus narrow industry-specific solutions
4. **Superior Tracking**: Proprietary sensor fusion technology for enhanced accuracy
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive SDK and API for easy integration
6. **Universal Configurator**: Free firmware tool to map glove as any input device
